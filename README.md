This is a simple snake which is written in C++ and partly with OOP. <br>
To run this code you must the following commands:
<ul>
    <li>1. 'mkdir Snake'</li>
    <li>2. 'cd Snake'</li>
    <li>3. 'git clone https://github.com/Danton666/Snake'</li>
    <li>4. 'make'</li>
    <li>5. './Snake'</li>
</ul>

After these steps you can change and improve the code. <br>
P.S: this code was written on Linux and tested there. <br>

Have a good day :) <br>

This is a simple snake which is written in C++ and partly with OOP. <br>
To run this code you must the following commands: <br>
    1. 'mkdir Snake' <br>
    2. 'cd Snake' <br>
    4. 'git clone https://github.com/Danton666/Snake' <br>
    5. 'make' <br>
    6. './Snake' <br>
<br>
After these steps you can change and improve the code. <br>
P.S: this code was written on Linux and tested there. <br>
<br>
Have a good day :) <br>

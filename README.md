This is a simple snake which is written in C++ and partly with OOP. <br>
To run this code you must the following commands: <br>
    <p style='margin-left:20px;'>1. 'mkdir Snake'</p>
    <p style='margin-left:20px;'>2. 'cd Snake'</p>
    <p style='margin-left:20px;'>3. 'git clone https://github.com/Danton666/Snake'</p>
    <p style='margin-left:20px;'>4. 'make'</p>
    <p style='margin-left:20px;'>5. './Snake'</p>
<br>
After these steps you can change and improve the code. <br>
P.S: this code was written on Linux and tested there. <br>
<br>
Have a good day :) <br>

This is a simple snake written in C++ with SFML and partly with OOP. <br><br>
To run this code you must have the SFML library installed, and you need to run the following commands:
<ol>
    <li><code>mkdir Snake</code></li>
    <li><code>cd Snake</code></li>
    <li><code>git clone https://github.com/Danton666/Snake</code></li>
    <li><code>make</code></li>
    <li><code>./Snake</code></li>
</ol>

After these steps, you can change and improve the code. <br>
P.S this code was written on Linux and tested there. <br>

Have a good day :) <br>

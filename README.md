This is a simple snake which is written in C++ and partly with OOP.
To run this code you must the following commands:
	1. 'mkdir Snake'
	2. 'cd Snake'
	4. 'git clone https://github.com/Danton666/Snake'
	5. 'make'
	6. './Snake'

After these steps you can change and improve the code.
P.S: this code was written on Linux and tested there.

Have a good day :)

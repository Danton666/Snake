This is a simple snake which is written in C++ with SFML and partly with OOP. <br><br>
To run this code you must have SFML library installed and you need to run the following commands:
<ol>
    <li>'mkdir Snake'</li>
    <li>'cd Snake'</li>
    <li>'git clone https://github.com/Danton666/Snake'</li>
    <li>'make'</li>
    <li>'./Snake'</li>
</ol>

After these steps you can change and improve the code. <br>
P.S: this code was written on Linux and tested there. <br>

Have a good day :) <br>

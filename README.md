This is a simple snake which is written in C++ and partly with OOP. <br>
To run this code you must the following commands: <br>
    <p style='margin-left:20px;'><pre>'mkdir Snake'</pre></p>
    <p style='margin-left:20px;'><pre>'cd Snake'</pre></p>
    <p style='margin-left:20px;'><pre>'git clone https://github.com/Danton666/Snake'</pre></p>
    <p style='margin-left:20px;'><pre>'make'</pre></p>
    <p style='margin-left:20px;'><pre>'./Snake'</pre></p>
<br>
After these steps you can change and improve the code. <br>
P.S: this code was written on Linux and tested there. <br>
<br>
Have a good day :) <br>
